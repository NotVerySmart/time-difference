# time-difference
This is a piece of code that converts timestamps (sql) to a more user friendly format like "2 days ago" or "3 weeks ago"

Version 1.0.0 commited on Nov 18 2018:
This is tested and working on Safari, Mozilla and Chrome browsers.
Input string should be in UTC time, the script will automatically compare it to the user's time no matter the timezone.
Feel free to look at examles.

I will be further developing this code to make it faster, cleaner and hopefully more accurate.
Version 1.1 will give an ES6 alternative to those who can afford not to support old browsers.
Version 2 is in stage of design, for loops will be ditched in favor of modulos(%).

Feel free to copy code to your project and use it.
