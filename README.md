# time-difference
This is a piece of code that converts timestamps(sql) to a more user friendly format like "2 days ago" or "3 weeks ago"

Version 1.0.0 commited on Nov 18 2018, I will be further developing this code to make it faster and hopefully more accurate.
This is tested and working on Safari, Mozilla and Chrome browsers.
Input string should be in UTC time, the script will automatically compare it to the user's time no matter the timezone.
Feel free to look at examles.

Version 2 is in stage of design, the for loops will be ditched in favor of modulos(%) probably.

Feel free to copy it to your project and use it.
